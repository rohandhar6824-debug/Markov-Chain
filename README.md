# Markov-Chain
Markov Chain for Weather Transitions
Key Features:
Weather State Transitions: Models how weather changes from one day to another

Transition Probability Matrix: Shows probabilities for all possible weather changes

Multi-day Forecasting: Can predict weather for several days ahead

Stationary Distribution: Calculates long-term weather probabilities

Seasonal Adjustments: Advanced version accounts for seasonal changes

Visualization: Creates graphs and heatmaps of transition probabilities

Sequence Probability: Calculates likelihood of specific weather patterns
